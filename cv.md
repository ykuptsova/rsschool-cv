## Code example:
**KATA from CODEWARS:** 
*If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in. Additionally, if the number is negative, return 0.*

```javascript
function solution(number){
  let sum = 0
  for (let i = 0; i < number; i++) {
    if (i % 3 === 0 || i % 5 === 0) sum += i
  }
  return sum  
}
